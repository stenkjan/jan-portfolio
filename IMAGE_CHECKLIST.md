# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Use QUICK_IMAGE_GUIDE.md Instead

This checklist is **outdated**. We no longer use Vercel Blob Storage.

## What Changed?

After analyzing the **nest-haus** project (as you requested), I discovered they use the **standard Next.js public folder** approach, NOT Vercel Blob Storage.

## New Approach

Images are now stored in: `/workspace/public/images/`

The **filenames remain the same**, but the location and upload method have changed.

## Updated Documentation

Please refer to these files instead:

1. **QUICK_IMAGE_GUIDE.md** - Simple 3-step guide (START HERE)
2. **IMAGE_STORAGE_UPDATE.md** - Full explanation
3. **IMAGE_ANALYSIS.md** - Complete technical analysis

## Filenames Still Valid

The exact filenames listed in this document are **still correct**:
- `produktdatenbank_produkt.png`
- `produktdatenbank_konfigurationen.png`
- etc.

Just copy them to `/workspace/public/images/` instead of blob storage.

**This blob storage approach is no longer used.**
