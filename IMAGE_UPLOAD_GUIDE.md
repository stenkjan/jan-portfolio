# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Use IMAGE_STORAGE_UPDATE.md Instead

This guide is **outdated**. We no longer use Vercel Blob Storage.

## What Changed?

After analyzing the **nest-haus** project (as you requested), I discovered they use the **standard Next.js public folder** approach, NOT Vercel Blob Storage.

## New Approach

Images are now stored in: `/workspace/public/images/`

## Updated Documentation

Please refer to these files instead:

1. **IMAGE_STORAGE_UPDATE.md** - Full explanation of the change
2. **QUICK_IMAGE_GUIDE.md** - Simple 3-step guide
3. **IMAGE_ANALYSIS.md** - Complete technical analysis

## Quick Instructions

1. Rename your 14 screenshots with exact filenames
2. Copy to: `/workspace/public/images/`
3. Done! They'll display automatically.

**This blob storage approach is no longer used.**
